There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and \"whompy wheels\" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension.

Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles.
